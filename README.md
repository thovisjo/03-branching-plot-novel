# 03-Branching-plot-novel

This is a branching plot novel for my class. I chose to utilize functions so that I could follow it a little better. It has 5 functions that I would call utilitarian.
These five have uses such as checking against the inventory and ending the game. The other functions follow the gameplay, and there are 26 of those. The story focuses
on a child who has been left alone with the cookie jar. Things go to a magical world called Sweetserland. I tried to check all the paths, but I remain unsure if they all work perfectly. Furthermore, I used the global keyword and took a few shortcuts that work but I was not happy with. I might go back and fix this and make it better. Thanks!
